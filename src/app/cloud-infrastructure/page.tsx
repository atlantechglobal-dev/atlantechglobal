const faqs: CloudFaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "What are cloud infrastructure services?",
    a: "Cloud infrastructure services provide the computing resources required to run business applications, including servers, storage, networking, virtualization, security, and cloud management. These services help organizations modernize IT infrastructure, improve scalability, reduce operational costs, and support business continuity across public, private, and hybrid cloud environments.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why should businesses migrate to cloud infrastructure?",
    a: "Migrating to the cloud replaces costly, rigid on-premises hardware with elastic capacity that scales with demand. Businesses gain faster deployment cycles, stronger security and resilience, built-in disaster recovery, and pay-for-what-you-use pricing, freeing internal teams to focus on innovation instead of maintenance.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the difference between public, private, and hybrid cloud?",
    a: "A public cloud shares provider-owned infrastructure such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud across many customers. A private cloud is dedicated to a single organization, on-premises or hosted. A hybrid cloud connects the two so workloads can run wherever cost, performance, latency, or compliance requirements fit best.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do cloud infrastructure services improve business security?",
    a: "Modern cloud platforms provide encryption, identity and access management, network segmentation, and continuous monitoring by default. Combined with a zero-trust architecture, automated patching, and SIEM threat detection, they reduce your attack surface and keep your compliance posture verifiable at all times.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do enterprise cloud solutions support business growth?",
    a: "Enterprise cloud solutions let you launch new products and enter new markets faster by scaling infrastructure on demand. Automation and cloud-native tooling shorten release cycles, while FinOps governance keeps spending aligned with the value delivered as your organization grows.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I choose the right cloud infrastructure partner?",
    a: "Look for a partner with proven migration experience, certified engineers across major cloud platforms, strong security and compliance credentials, and transparent cost governance. The right partner starts with a readiness assessment of your environment, then delivers a clear roadmap and measurable outcomes rather than a one-size-fits-all package.",
